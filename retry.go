// approach is useful for scenarios where intermittent issues are resolved,
// allowing the system to promptly react to new errors without being delayed
// by the increased backoff time accumulated from previous failures.
//
// Clearing the Next field directly is an alternative, that will allow the next
// attempt immediately, without resetting the attempt count.
